Confocal laser scanning microscopy and image analysis
Plants and recombinant HyPer7 were imaged in a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss
LSM 780, connected to an Axio Observer.Z1; Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany) using a 5x
lens (EC Plan-Neofluar 5x/0.16) or a 40x lens (C-Apochromat 40x/1.2 W Korr). Samples were
mounted in imaging buffer (10 mM MES, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, pH 5.8). All
sensors were sequentially excited at 488 nm and 405 nm, and the fluorescence emission was
collected at 508–535 nm. **The laser power was adjusted according to the respective relative excitation efficiencies on the two excitation peaks of the respective probes.** 
Imaging was performed without averaging with a pixel dwell time of 1.58 µs/pixel. Samples were scanned
in areas set to 235.7 µm x 235.7 µm, 124.8 µm x 124.8 µm or 60.7 µm x 60.7 µm. Hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) and dithiothreitol (DTT) perfusion experiments were performed as described
in (Ugalde et al., 2020) using a RC-22 perfusion chamber mounted on a P1 platform (Warner
Instruments, Hamden, CT). To inhibit photosystem II (PSII), samples were pre-treated for
45 min with 20 μM 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) in the dark (SigmaAldrich, Steinheim, Germany) dissolved in ethanol. **The fluorescence ratio was calculated as**
405 nm / 488 nm for roGFP2-Orp1 and **488 nm / 405 nm for HyPer and HyPer7 and normalized to the ratio values at the start of the experiments (t = 0 min).** Ratiometric imaging
and analysis of single plane images was performed with a custom-written MATLAB script
(Fricker, 2016) or FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012).
